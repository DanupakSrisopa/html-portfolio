<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a graduate student from Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology in Computer engineering department. My previous job I used to work for is as Jr Data engineering at PTTEP Services Co.,Ltd. Currently looking for an new opportunity to using my current skill that I obtain up until now and try to improving it more. I am love to learn and try new things out, so that I keep pushing myself forward. What I hope to gain from this is the more new experience as well as learn more about stuff I might miss out. I am a honest and hardworking person.</p>
